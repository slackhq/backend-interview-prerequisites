# Requirements

To ensure that your system will be able to run the backend onsite excercise in Java we suggest you use this test project as a tool for troubleshooting. 

Please check that:
- you can import this project into whatever IDE you will be using during the onsite interview
- all maven dependencies are successfully installed on build
- you are able to run JUnit tests in this repository
- all tests pass

If all these checks succeed - you're all set up for the interview!

## Dependencies

* Java version >= 8
* Maven version >= 3.8.0

The rest of dependencies will be installed via maven. Please refer to [pom.xml](./pom.xml) to see full list of dependencies.

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure that JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables are set up correctly
2. Check that you have correct java and maven versions installed
3. Try running tests via maven CLI versus runnging them from IDE

If all else fails, please file an issue against this repository containing the details of your operating system and any relevant stacktraces.
