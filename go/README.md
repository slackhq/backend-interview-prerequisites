# WIP - This is not yet ready for use

# Requirements

To check that your system can run the backend onsite exercise in Go, run the `setup.sh` script included in this directory (if you're on Windows, run `setup.bat` "currently missing" instead).

We encourage you to use whatever setup is most comfortable for you, whether that's running the script locally, in Docker, or in a VM. As long as the `setup` script runs successfully, you should be good to go.

## Dependencies

* A Go version >= 1.18.
* [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (this comes pre-installed on most operating systems).

## Troubleshooting

If for some reason the `setup` script won't run successfully, try the following:

- Ensure that your PHP version is >= 1.18.
- Ensure that SQLite3 is installed.

If you try the above and are still having trouble, please reach out to your recruiting coordinator and we'll do our best to assist you. If possible, please include relevant stacktraces and system details (OS and language versions, etc) in your message.
