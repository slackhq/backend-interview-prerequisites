# backend-interview-prerequisites

A project to ensure that your backend onsite interview at Slack runs smoothly.

## Usage

If you can successfully run the `setup` script for the language of your choice, you should be able to run the actual interview project as well.

1. Download the most recent release of `backend-interview-prerequisites` [here](https://github.com/slackhq/backend-interview-prerequisites/releases/latest).
1. Unzip the project and navigate to the directory for your preferred language.
1. Follow the instructions in the README for your preferred language to run the `setup` script. If you plan to complete the onsite in Docker or some other containerized environment, we encourage you to run the `setup` script in that environment instead.
1. If for some reason the `setup` script does not run successfully, follow troubleshooting steps in the README for your preferred language.
1. (Optional) Configure the project in your preferred IDE to confirm that your IDE will also support the backend onsite interview.
